Welcome! My name is jes godinez. I am a passionate geographer and environmental enthusiast. I am set to graduate from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in Spring 2024 with a B.A. in Geography and Environmental Studies, accompanied by a certificate in GIS (Geographic Information Systems).

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep appreciation for understanding the intricate relationship between the Earth's physical and human systems. My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in various geospatial technologies and analytical tools. I am experienced in ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and R Studio, utilizing these platforms to analyze spatial data, create maps, and derive meaningful insights.

Beyond the classroom, I have actively engaged in hands-on community-oriented projects, where I intend to conduct geospatial analysis and contribute to impactful research initiatives. These experiences will hone my ability to apply GIS techniques to real-world challenges and generate practical solutions.

I am driven by a desire to make a positive impact on environmental sustainability and contribute to evidence-based decision-making. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my geographic knowledge, coupled with my GIS expertise, to address complex environmental issues and foster sustainable development.

I am a dedicated learner, always seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and stay abreast of emerging trends in the field. I am excited to embark on a professional journey that allows me to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations, working towards a greener, more resilient future.

Feel free to connect with me to explore potential collaborations or discuss ideas related to geography, environmental studies, and GIS. Together, let's navigate the world through maps and data to create positive change!
